+ TaskScheduleDisjointSet: how to use disjoint set
+ TaskScheudle1: greedy algorithm
+ see also MinimumSpanningTree

#What can we learn from TaskSchedule
+ **greedy**. Schedule the one with biggest penalty first if possible.
+ work from end. We are so used to work from beginning. But many CS problem is **offline** problem, we can work from end.

#Activity Schedule
+ Lecture Hall. If we use graph color, we use an incident list
+ Weighted Schedule DAG. We could also use incident list. DAG has a close relationship with Incident list.
+ Optimization problem can be transformed to graph problem.
