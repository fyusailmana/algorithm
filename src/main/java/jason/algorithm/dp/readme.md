1. Smell like a DP question: longest, smallest, biggest, shortest: it is optimization problem
2. How to tackle DP problem
Start from final case. f(n). **don't start from beginning f(1)**
	final case can be arrived from one or **more** sub cases f(n-1)
	solve it using recursion instead of bottom up approach since recursion is easy to think
	tabular sub case using array or matrix.
	If complex data need tracking, use class object instead of simple index.
