#[Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) is a data structure ** between map and BST**
##** between map and BST**
+ Can be used as map. Lookup may not work as well as map, but there is no rehash, no collision. 
+ can be used as BST, all key are sorted. 
+ Run time is |m|. |m| is the key string

**Drawback**
+ Lookup may not perform as well as hash table
+ May require **more memory**

Binary trie (Radix tree, digital tree)
