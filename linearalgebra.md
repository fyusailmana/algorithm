+ **vector**: directed number, usually represented as column in matrix. Vector consists of **component**. Why column: It is easy to express linear combination
+ **unit vector**: vector of length one. (1, 0, 0), has one in only one of dimension
+ **vector space**: all vectors in one dimension. E.g R<sup>3</sup>
+ **basis of vector space**: Any vector from a vector space can be produced from a linear combination of the set of vector. Minimum number of vectors that can form a vector space
+ **dimension of vector space** length of any its basis
+ **standard basis **: a set of unit vectors.
+ **linear independent**: a vector in a set can not be linear combination of all other vectors
+ **span of V**: all possible combination of vector in V
+ **Transformation**: create a new vector from in input vector using arimetic operation on vector component
